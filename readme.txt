The space squirrel has been hibernating for winter at a nearby planet Double V.
Unfortunately while hibernating, a big space bug ate the squirrel.
You, as a squirrel have to find your way back to surface. From there you can fly back home.
Remember to eat as many icecreams as possible to neutralize the bugs digestive system acids!

Good luck and may the Silicogel be with you!
