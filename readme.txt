- Story -
---------

The space squirrel has been hibernating for winter at a nearby planet Double W.
Unfortunately while hibernating, a big space bug ate the squirrel.
You, as a squirrel have to find your way back to surface. From there you can fly back home.
Avoid rats and worms and eat all icecreams as they neutralize the bugs digestive system acids!
Every icecream left over will reduce your life by one. Same with worms and rats if they hit you.

Good luck and may the Silicogel be with you!
